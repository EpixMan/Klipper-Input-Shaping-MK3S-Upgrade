# Prusa MK3S/+ Klipper Config

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment
# the files and/or settings you need.

# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:

(THESE LINKS SHOULD PROBABLY GO ELSEWHERE)

# 1) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html (WE SHOULD NOTE TO USERS THAT PRUSAS DON'T USE END STOPS, THESE CHECKS ALSO INCLUDE THE PID CALIBRATION)
# 2) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html (DOCS SAY TO RE-DO PRESSURE ADVANCE, SO PERHAPS MAKES MORE SENSE TO DO AFTER)
# 3) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/Skew_Correction.html (Seems fairly advanced, is there a way we can do Prusa-like "Self Test" or Perpendicular checks? I haven't ever had to touch this on my Prusa. There's also been a recent video by CNC Kitchen on a few superior calibration objects based on very smart thinking...I really don't want to do this step and I'm sure others won't either)
# 4) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html

### MACROS
[include klipper-prusa-mk3s/macros.cfg]

# FIRST RUN: 
# Execute these sequentially in the console, let PID tuning finish before saving
# PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=170
# SAVE_CONFIG
# PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60 (THIS PROCESS NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED BETTER ON WHAT YOU DO WITH THE VALUES OUTPUT, also need to test if this works if they're already defined)
# SAVE_CONFIG

# You can also skip the above setting for stock Prusa and use (CHARMIN NOTE - Why would I want these?)
# min_temp: 0
# max_temp: 305
# min_extrude_temp: 170


### The end, on the end the printer will store it's tuning data, so do not edit it.
